# Car-Leasing-Calculator
A user-friendly leasing calculator.

### My Briefly Solution
<b> </b>
1. I started by creating an html page with the content described in the instructions, four fields for user input and a section for the lease details.
   
2. Then I added a styles.css file to style the page as close as possible to the design shown in the pictures.
  
3. After doing the content and styling of the page I added the js. a file containing the calculations of the leasing details according to the provided business rules and the validation of the data entered by the user, as well as event listeners for the data entered by the user, so that the information is updated automatically.
